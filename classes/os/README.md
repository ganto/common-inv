### OS Class ###

<!-- -meta- basic -->
This collection is thought to contain the meta information
of the operating system distributions in use.

<!-- -meta- detail -->
As e.g. the installation files might be useful outside a certain
hosts configuration and therefore might be different from the
current hosts distro - imagine a virtualization host, that must
be able to access the installation files for creating a new VM
host - a distro meta data file can be split up in several files,
where. The main distro file will then be referenced for the
current host and the other files might be used outside the context
of their respective distribution.
