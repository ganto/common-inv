### Applications ###

<!-- -meta- basic -->
This is the collection of application specific information.

<!-- -meta- detail -->
For the sake of modularity, the classes here should not use other
classes outside of 'app' or 'service'.
(TODO: currently there is one variable used from the project
class - 'project\_destination' - we need to eliminate it here..)
