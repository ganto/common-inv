### Reclass Host Class ###

<!-- -meta- basic -->
As nodes always run on something else, here it shows how they are
hosted.

<!-- -meta- detail -->
Every node has its own resource description in this directory. This information
can be used both by the host itself (node) and by its host (virtualization-host).
