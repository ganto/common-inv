### Admins ###

<!-- -meta- basic -->
Define the admins here, i.e. real persons, for your hosts. If you
are only connecting as root, please do leave the variable 'admins'
open/in place - as the automation managers
(playbooks/states/promisses/whatever) may depend on the variable
as a base for taking action (iterate over its content)...
